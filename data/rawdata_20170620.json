If your credit card is stored on your account you will have the option to top up (by for example pressing the '*' key (for the main menu) and then the '3' key to add credit over the phone).We have refunded your remaining balance.

    "text": "Updated review as at 17/06/17:-Further to my earlier review, I intent to provide some further update regarding the awful service Rebtel provide. I will shed lights on the call quality, call drops and feedback/help  I have received from Rebtel when complained about the service. -I used to have a subscription for unlimited calls to Bangladesh, however, Rebtel increased the monthly subscription from \u00a39.99 to \u00a320.99 when I provided negative review about the co and its awful service. - Despite the increase in monthly charge, I still use Rebtel, however every ten/fifteen minutes my calls are dropped, when I complain, they email me a robotic message which goes on to say \"Hi MR, My name is Sophie and I work with customer satisfaction at Rebtel. I noticed that you just rated your last call with 1 out of 5 stars on its quality. Something didn't work for you and I want to understand why. Not only because I want to fix any technical issues straight away, but more importantly because offering you the best call quality is my number 1 priority. So, help me understand what went wrong: Were you calling from home or on the go?Does it only happen when you call that specific number?If this was the first time the problem happened, what was different this time?I really want to solve the problem so anything you can tell me is a HUGE help and I really appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time :) /Sophie\"Once you provide the info. nothing else happens! Because its f...g rebtel, they don't care about the customer experience as long as they get the monthly charge!My intention is to give this co a lesson before I cancel the subscription!The worst company, the worst possible customer customer service and its very expensive. Please DON'T GIVE A PENNY TO THIS FAKE COMPANY.Each time I report that I cannot make a call , I get an automated message saying \"please provide details of your call\"once I provide the details I get no more reply. I have an unlimited account with Rebtel to call Bangladesh but I couldn't make any calls in the last two days. When I kept reporting the issues I no longer get a reply even. Rebtel as a company you're disgusting and have disgraceful customer service. We all should boycott you!You're saying you can't locate my account , my phone number is 00447878075930, I have lodged 20 complaints and one standard copied message and no solution! Because I lodged complaints from mobile there is no ticket number. However I am sure Rebtel can check how many I begged them to sort out my connection, AWFUL COMPANY, YOU SHOULD BE SHAMED FOR YOUR SERVICE !Updated on 23/05/17: Rebtel have deactivated my subscription after writing this review. When asked why they have cancelled my unlimited calls subscription, their reply were we can't allow you to make unlimited calls ON AN UNLIMITED PLAN because it is not sustainable.",

Just make sure to change the settings from both your native phone and the app as follow:1. Native settings: turn off the roaming data to avoid any extra cost from your operator and enable only your WiFi connection.2. On the Rebtel app: change your preferred calling method from \"Settings\" (the last icon to the right) to \u201cWiFi\u201d and also select \"Avoid roaming charges\".Feel free to contact us at support@rebtel.com if more information needed.Best regards,/Pilar.",

They only responded after I asked them to cancel my order and refund my $10. They did not even acknowledge that I asked them to cancel the order and pretended I never asked and just sent me a message like everything was ok ignoring the questions I was asking them.Edit 3: Please do not say they responded as soon as I contacted them. They did not. They took their time. I had to threaten to cancel my order for them to respond.",

The  staff 'investigate' but came back with woolly explainations that don't explain how the system has recently changed.

You couldn't also have refunded it onto my credit card which is what I used for topping up the credit for Rebtel but it's not in use anymore. To emphasise my point you couldn't have possibly refunded the credit, you're certainly not truthful to your customers. I checked my rebtel account today 16th April 17 @ 22.12 and notice the credit I had on there for \u00a321.50 has been cleared to \u00a30.00 and I've never used it because the App  does not work it is useless completely useless. Rebtel is an App I can't use and my credit has been cleared and I haven't got any refund back. I feel like I've been robbed. Not happy with this App. Rebtel requested I update the App last year and I did. Since then I haven't been able to make a single international call but now Pilar from rebtel is telling me I still have the old app so I've just updated it again and its still no use. I have over \u00a320 credit on the App. I need my money refunded in full so I can make these important calls to my family abroad. I don't want to keep playing the old app game.

You will see the funds returned to your bank account in 3-5 business days.The ticket number #1147276 where we were taking care of you was updated, please check your email. The reason why you cannot see any balance is that we refunded the credit to your bank account, as you requested.Best regards,/Pilar.",

Secondly, they have a useless subscription called 'World Credits' which charges you more than the prevalent deals for specific countries. When you opt for recharge over phone, you will not be subscribed to your preferred country deal rather be parked on World Credit. You will keep talking on that useless world credit subscription which will get as it is outside the deal. This is a clear cut unethical practice by Rebtel and monopoly. I am waiting for a competitor to come on board to switch over soon.",

This way, those people who call many countries will save more credit buying World Credit instead of several Subscriptions, so they pay for what they use.So when you make a purchase the system does not check what country you call, simply manage the purchase you are doing. Also the auto renewal can only be managed by the user, so please make always sure that all the options are enabled/disabled according to your choice.Feel free to contact us emailing us at support@rebtel.com if more information needed.Best regards,/Pilar.",

I was without any telecom services for about a day and I had to call my parents in India. They provide expired codes to our company maybe so that people like us would sign up for an account and then bam! That is it, you don't get any credit against that voucher. I had to flip through the FAQs, read help articles and then they thought they had their fun so after 15 minutes of struggle the website gave me chat option. I still wasn't losing faith in them. I talked to an agent and he was rude and absurd. I even told him how important it was for me to make a call to India. He was totally helpless and I don't even think how to treat customers. He didn't even what I was talking about! When I thought he is not helping me out, I rated him 1 star and ended the conversation. He came back to me saying I was rude for giving him 1 star and that he was thinking of giving me some credit. That was unacceptable since I did not want to talk to him and ended the chat, he had no right to reopen the chat and send me messages.

The welcome page says Unlimited Calls to India and Try One week free. I created an account on Nov 8th 2:25 PM hence I was eligible under free trial until Nov 15th. I decided to continue hence a payment of $10 was deducted from my card on 15th November. I made numerous calls from November 8th till yesterday to India but got a shock of my life when T-Mobile Service Provider sent me a hefty bill for all those calls. They told all those calls were made using their Network Towers. I emailed Rebtel Immediately since deliberately there is no customer care number given to call. Another shock I got when a customer care Representative told me that my free trial was expired on same day of activation i.e November 8th and it is reactivated on Nov 15 so now you can make calls. I told about my whole experience and the way he replied was very insensitive and unprofessional. If such is the start experience how can I trust you guys further if me or any of my known person want to use your services?Anish Purushothaman",

But what i found is , i could not  able to make call more than 8 TO 10 unique numbers .That means ! the numbers you are accesing are limited . if you try accessing more than this a voice message will inform you that \u00a8you have crossed the limitation of unique numbers\u00a8 . so it is clear that you cannot call more random numbers in an unlimited scheme but you can call unlimited to your limited numbers means numbers you used to talk frequently. And Rebtel did not mention this properly  when they advertising as \u00a8Hijacking real phone lines to liberate international calling\u00a8 or \u00a8cheap as hell \u00a8 in their website .And their is no even any official customer contact or support for Rebtel. If you had to face any Real time  issues . You need to mail them about it  . i wonder why ? but may rebtel  still using 1 gen computers .Rebtel is just a shiityy cheat as hell like other cheap vendors like ringo !! instead of using this i just now shifted to lebara cards which they provide a separate sim , providing 5000 min under 5 euro .And freely accessible to unique numbers and also has a unlimited date validity .",

Rebtel includes unethical business practices.",
    "answer": "Hi Fariba,After reviewing your account we can see that the autorecharge was active. That is the reason why when your credit was under 1USD, 10USD were added so you could keep on making calls.Since the credit added in your account was used to make calls, we could only refund the $3.79 you had left.If you have any question or you would like to discuss further, reply to the ticket #1019641 or contact us in our Rebtel Help page in Facebook.Best regards,/Fernando.",

Last month, I reached out to them asking why i was charged twice and they said, sorry, it was their system error and they cant refund, instead i can use their service for the amount they charged me. Which means I only wanted 30 days of service and they forced me 60 days service by charging twice. They also said, this won't repeat. I removed my credit card details and added a new credit card so that, they wont use my old credit card to charge twice again. Just found they have again charged me twice on the new credit card. I really don't know what to do with these guys . I mean they is a limit to which you can be so careless about customer service.

    "text": "They have given advertisement on the web to call india 10$ for One month and 7 days. Opened the account on 3rd July and fed my credit card details on my Rebtel account then they gave a link to download their APPS but the beauty is that Link did not work and tried for two weeks to download their apps meanwhile they have taken 10USD from my account even though you were not using their services and No customer service number also but when i chatting thru Customer support, did not get proper solution after downloaded their application in two weeks, just used their service only two days, On next day when i am calling to India, says no enough credit to call India, approached customer support  why i could not make call? do you know what they said CathyDo you have a credit on  your local phone plan?I have taken a look at your account and I see no apparent reason why you are unable to call.The first thing we kindly ask you is to make sure that you have enough credit on your phone (not on the Rebtel account); Since you have to pay for the local call to our numbers with your local minutes while the international cost of the call is deducted from your prepaid Rebtel credit.Why i should pay my local numbers, then i realised, i am completely cheated by them",
    "answer": "Hi Rajuy,We are sorry for the confusion, let us explain: when you use Rebtel to call with the local minutes option you pay to your local provider the cost of a local call and to Rebtel the international part, which is a very low fee.If you call with Rebtel and using data (WiFi, 3G or 4G) then you pay nothing to your local provider and only pay to Rebtel the low fee for your international call.You can choose which option you want to use to call, and switch between them at any time.Please send us a private message via our Facebook Rebtel Help page: facebook.com/RebtelHelp providing your account details (ph number and email address registered) and we will explain hoe to switch between local minutes and data calls, and definitively take a second look at your credit.Thank you!W.",

Thanks to Google, I was able to find out their well buried 'Report a Problem' button and send a few messages. At first, I received replies with staff's names listed in the end of the messages, though the replies are not for my issues, or just a product of 'copy and paste' in my opinion. As it went on, I could only receive automatic replies generated by system itself. As for now, I filled another web form days ago, no response, even from a machine, yet.Their new logo is shiny, so is their new website. However, if you dare look for their contact information, you are assured of disappointment. Except for a 'Report a problem' button, you will find nothing else. If you are lucky enough, you will receive their machine-generated replies, or nothing at all.You can smell it that the 'machine' is still running there, but the people who run it are absent.

When calling through Rebtel, you always hear rings even if its not ringing at other line, no way to know if other party's ph is switched off, not reachable, busy, call waiting etc...Above features are readily available on other voip apps like Nymgo, not sure why Rebtel team has not taken care of these...",

    "answer": "Hi!When you call through our app, you can choose between connecting your calls with local minutes of WiFi. If you choose local minutes, your call gets connected via our Access Number. This means that you will be charged by your local carrier the price of a local call (depending on your calling plan).For more information about charges related to the use of your operator's services (3G and local minutes), we recommend you to consult them directly as we do not have access to that information.To avoid this charge choose \"WiFi\" as a calling method.If you have any other question you can reach us in our Rebtel Help in Facebook./Fernando.",

    "text": "My complaint is regarding Rebtel VOIP provider.Rebtel is a VOIP provider (they provide affordable calls to international numbers) with local access numbers.First you register (with your own telephone number from your country) for their service, buy a minimal credit of 5\u20ac + EU tax, and then you enter an international number you wish to call, and Rebtel gives you an local number. When you call this local number that Rebtel gave you (you can only call it from your own number that you register with), Rebtel will connect you with an international number you wish to call.Like I said, first you need to register (enter it to Rebtel system via web interface) your own number (from wich you will be calling) and also that international number that you wish to call.Everything went well and everything was O.K. for first 100 minutes, which they charged me per minute at their calling rate price. Then Rebtel start to make this harassments and demands to tell them what is this number that I am calling (it was just one Estonian mobile number), to whom this number belongs, and why am I calling just and only this number (?!).Also they suspended my account (I can not make calls anymore, although I still have valid balance, and I paid for this service upfront), telling me that it is for my own protection. I do not understand why, as I registered all numbers in their system, and I paid for this service, therefor, I should call whoever I want. But Rebtel thinks that I should explain to them why am I calling this number, and who is the owner of this Estonian mobile number that I was calling! Outrageous!Also, I recomended several of my friends (because until now I was really satisfied with the quality of their service and price), and one of them got suspended also!When they suspend you, you got an automatic e-mail telling you that you are suspended, and you can not login, or make new calls even if you have balance and you paid for this service upfront. You have to write them and ask why they suspended you and why you can not use this service that you paid for, then you have to wait for their answer, and then this harrassment started.I believe that I did not done anything wrong, I registered and paid for this service, I was calling Estonian mobile number and they charged me per minute at their calling rate price. But, as I said, after 100 minutes they suspended my account and started to harassment me with these questions and asked me to provide them with some informations that was not their concern.I paid for the service, they charged me, and therefore, I should call whoever I want, even this is one Estonian number, without explaining myself to anyone. I did not done anything wrong. But no, they suspended my account and they started to harassment me.My friend has also the same problem. We selected Rebtel as they have the most affordable calling rates for Estonia, and they provided you with local number to call. So it was really affordable, and I would (and I did!) recommended Rebtel to anyone, but then this started.So I writting this complaint to let everyone know what did Rebtel done and what can you expect from Rebtel.",

With our service you can call any regular Estonian number (mobiles and landlines) but we do not support calls to Premium numbers yet.We asked you for owner of the number to be able to understand if it is a private number or if it belongs to some kind of company or administration.

Also the call connects even if the other party's phone is switched off this is very bad And am taking a star out for that. It made me think my fianc\u00e9e was quarrelling with me and won't pick up her phone whereas her phone was completely off because she couldn't charge he phone. Also my credit got deducted for those dials about 20min plus because I continued dialing and each dial lasted 2 mins each which really made me mad. well am over it now.

I have asked RebTel to clarify this matter for me and also either refund the second payment or advise me of an alternative. I've advised RebTel that if I don't get a response pertaining the payments I will be forced to contact my bank/credit provider and advise them to cancel the relevant payments!!I assured RebTel of my continued attention with relation to these matters but still have had NO RESPONSE!!!By the comments I have read here on TrustPilot it appears as though RebTel's reputation leaves a lot to be desired!!!It saddens me greatly to say this but  if you value your time and money then avoid this company at all costs!

And they are not apologetic at all for this kind of scam. And if you go and check their website, whoever used this app once, became victim of overcharging. Moreover, they're being racist. This is what I personally noticed. As, they are ruling this app from US, bcoz they are charging us in U.s. $. If they see, you are either Indian, Pakistani (which one can easily recognize from our name), they'll never ever offer you refund for those fake payments and overpayments. Please be careful and if you still wanna use this app, keep an eye on ur account. If, m the only one, who hav this problem. Then I could b wrong.

    "text": "Update: after back-and-forth messages with the customer service - I should point out that they assigned a different agent per email - I have received a compensation. Mind you, this only came about after days of having to explain and pressurizing their customer service agents.When you order a $10 meal off of a menu in a restaurant, how much do you expect to pay for it when you ask for the bill? In normal state of affairs,  you'd pay the price listed in the menu. But the same logic does not apply to Rebtel's service, which I found out through a first-hand experience. I come from Uzbekistan, and was pleased to learn that I could stay in touch with my family as Rebtel seemingly offered a very attractive rate to call numbers in the country: 0.023 EUR per minute. However, after a few calls it came to my attention that I was running out of credit way too quickly. Upon reviewing my activity log, I was disturbed to learn that the company had charged me between 0.23 to 1.34 EUR per minute on different calls to the exact same numbers. That is 10 and 58 times the rate which is indicated on the app - 0.023 EUR/min - which also conveniently shows up before I made the each call.  I quote from the customer service response to my inquiry regarding this matter: \"I can assure you that we wanted to keep the same rates, but we were forced to increase them due to capacity issues and to be able to sustain the same level of quality.\"Going back to the restaurant comparison: in a similar scenario to the one I am experiencing with Rebtel, you'd be paying anywhere between $100 to $580 for the $10 meal you had ordered. And you would find that out only after you had eaten the damn food. The server would kindly inform you that \"due to capacity issues\" the meal you just ate got much more expensive now - so deal with it. No restaurant would be allowed to continue conducting business in this fraudulent manner, and neither should any company. Avoid this service if you do not feel like dealing with multiple customer service agents just to get your money back.",
    "answer": "Hi Umrbek!We can offer different rates for Uzbekistan. If you call to landline numbers, the rate we can offer is 0.023 EUR per minute but if you call to mobiles, you will pay 56 cents per minute. We can see that you are using our Windows Phone app and we have noticed this version of the app might not be showing the updated rates.We have updated your ticket 905270 including a compensation for the wrong information shown from our side. I have shared this feedback with our technical team to make the needed changes.Best regards./Fernando.",

    "text": "I have never been treated so badly by any service. I have been a customer with Rebtel for 6 years and never had cause to worry till April, 23rd 2010. They took money from my account (supposedly my monthly subscription charge) without an email or adding minutes to my account. I had a monthly subscription and it was all going well. I would get an email immediately it's gone through and also have the minutes loaded into my Rebtel account.My bank on the other hand has never alerted me of a fraud purchase but for this purchase they did. First thing I did before confirming it was a fraud was to check my inbox for an email and also my Rebtel account for the minutes purchased but to my bewilderment, there was no email sent, neither was there $15 worth minutes added to my account so I responded a \"no\" to my bank. It was a type yes or no answer if you recognize that purchase and an email or the purchased minutes in question, I didn't recognize that purchase.Rebtel went ahead to restrict my access to my account. I have not been able to use the $9 worth of minutes I already had in my account for almost two weeks.They clearly showed great detest stating that I should have notified them first before notifying my bank. I went to great lengths explaining to them that - this had never happened, - I didn't go to my bank, they reached out to me - I waited for hours to receive their email to confirm the payment,- I also asked them to check their records and see that I never got an email confirmation of my payment as is always the case.- I also said my minutes weren't added. They sent me emails insisting it was there. I have sent over 6 emails to them explaining but they have told me they will not give me access to my account unless I call my bank and admit the charge, get them to provide a written letter stating it was not a fraud and sent the letter to me. My entire friends and family who have also been in Rebtel for over 7 years are shocked.I have never been backmailed in my life and to think that I would betray my person considering also the services my bank provides me in protecting my account is just beyond me.Rebtel is basically punishing me for refusing to be blackmailed. After over 6 years of being on this service why would I jump up to create a dispute if they were no grounds? It was a clear fraud and I feel bad I have recommended them to all my family and friends in US and the UK? And for $15? I guess a smart way is to make me loose my $9 as well.Never leave your account details on file here if you want to keep enjoying this service.",

Once the dispute is cancelled we will make sure to review your case and compensate you for any inconveneince caused.We are really greatful for having you using our for 6 years and we will do our best to keep on offering you the best service possible./Fernando.",

This the worst case of cheating the customer as the money is taken upfront and the terms are changed after. Is done so sneakily - without notifying the customer as well. The amount I have given these people is not much, but I feel disgusted by such enterprises which feel can do this and hide behind their T&Cs (which I am sure they have for this type of situation). I hope that this review will discourage people from using this service as there are plenty of alternatives.

Price sky rocketing per min from 2,5c to 35c. Mad increased in price without any notification. I dont understand how this can happen??  This is  a joke or scam or what??? Also on the day i been offerd subscription unlimited calls for 7$per month to one european country. Now I dont see any subscription available particulary for that country at all. What I noticed  this crowd working so tricky and fools the people. They advertising and promoting product/service for one price, but at the end consumer gets absolutely different price. This matter  should be reported to consumer protection authorities this absolutely ilegal to act in the way they does. They should be sued for breaching consumer rights.

They posted on their Facebook page that they couldn't connect calls. Of course I haven't even opened my own Facebook profile in years, how would I know, so I make calls unknowingly that Rebtel is not working. Mind you, voice system says everything it says on any other normal day, \"Welcome to Rebel please enter the international number you want to call'\" etc. So I call, I have topped up my account with about 500 minutes so I'm not even worried. I make my usual calls, to all my relatives, friends unknowingly. The next day I find out that instead of charging my Rebtel account as was supposed to happen all the calls (now I know it was due to their connectivity issues) of course AT&T picked them all up and now I had a $400 bill. After five days of trying to contact them, I wind up having to contact them through Facebook, and they end up saying oh we don't see any of your calls on our logs, well of course if your system was actually down you aren't going to see anything. Then they say we'll give you $20 credit as a sign of good faith. $400, $20 , good faith? Come on now. And then they try hide behind the issue of not interfering with third parties, no this is about how your system fooled me.

And then started emails every other day, suggesting me to try other browser, deleting cookies etc. \u2013 one email \u2013 one suggestion.  It took exactly 14 days for the issue to be fixed by their technical team.  Now the new saga \u2013 can\u2019t edit my local numbers or add any other.  I contacted the customer service again.

To be fair for the last three years I have been using google voice and Cuballama both of which have dropped calls, and sometimes it's almost impossible to hear eachother - as seems to be the case for most Cuban communications. I had high hopes having read the reviews on using Rebtel to call Cuba and getting crystal clear connections. So far: most of the time when I call it doesn't even ring on his end, and it eventually (1.5 min or more of ringing) it takes me to a message from Verizon (my carrier) saying the call couldn't be completed. Once in a while it connects perfectly and I can hear him very well - the best so far. He can not hear me as well, one time he got clear reception of my voice. My problem is the few times we have successfully connected, a few minutes into the conversation it drops the call and then I cannot get it to connect to him again no matter how many times I try to reconnect. It's so frustrating. I usually cannot get it to ring through to him again until the next day - and then again only once and only for about 10 minutes before it drops the call and won't reconnect. Like I said I had high hopes. ;(",

Too Expensive: - in this day and age when there are apps for calling for free and clearly, there simply is no justification for such high prices for calls.2. Despite length of time using rebtel, you would think there would be special loyalty discounts to those of us who have used their services for such extended periods. In this day and age where every business is finding ways of rewarding customer loyalty and offering all sorts, it seems all Rebtel is about, is people using its services and loyalty does not factor into the equation. Why then should anyone want to continue with such an organization if benefits are one-sided!!",

    "text": "My provider in Belgium (Telenet) have charged me for all the calls I have made via 2  deals to South AfricaI purchased via REBTEL.  Calls which should have cost me \u20ac23,80 have now been charged to me for the amount of \u20ac361,10. My provider have rejected my request for investigation that the calls were made via a REBTEL contact number as on the REBTEL  site. I have subsequently mailed Rebtel and am waiting for an answer.   I cannot believe this has happened and have requested they pay my provider (refund me) for the costs incurred.  Just getting my money back that I have paid via credit card to REBTEL is not an option as the purchase was made in good faith so that I could call cheaply to South Africa.   I hope there is a procedure for REBTEL  to take their full responsibility for this problem as they have reputable reviews which I checked at length before signing up for their service.  I advise that REBTEL remove deals from their website to avoid other people becoming victims of the same fate as it is for a reason we use REBTEL. NOT to be charged by our providers. January I used REBTEL via a contact number in Brussels to contact South Africa and my provider did not charge me.  February they charged me for every call made.  I sent 2 mails to REBTEL support last night with  proof of my bill from my provider clearly stating the number I called was the number given on the site as a the contact number for the country I was calling which was +27 87 550 23 47;  and will have to wait the 48 hours it will take to get an answer. I hope REBTEL contact my provider to sort this out as there is nowhere I can find a telephone number for customer service as everything has to be done by mail.  I hope and trust REBTEL will  solve this as it a very unpleasant experience. I have always had good response from Patricia at customer service.  In the meantime do not make any calls using a REBTEL contact number in your destination country.  Your provider will charge you full price.  Now is the time for me and for all of us  to really rate REBTEL on their customer service and solving this problem.   It is when things go wrong that the reviews really count.  I will keep everyone posted on progress in this matter.",

    "text": "Hi there,I had been using the Vonage service from United States to call my people in Asia-India and elsewhere, Australia or Dubai, Malaysia and Singapore though it was little expensive(every month charge will be fixed, 40-50$).However, I was disconnected from the network and I was looking for a cheap method to call India , from my cell phone itself. I had been seeing Rebtel ads but, I was initially apprehensive to use a new and unknown network and also was concerned about the reliability, money transactions etc. But, once I set up my account with the phone number, I found the ease of using it-U can set up local numbers for the international numbers you want to contact and also, dial in from the app whenever necessary, if u want to call any new no that is not stored.So, this is the first advantage. Secondly, they have quite a wide range of plans-depending on fixed and variable talk times. Also, the cost of using it is much reduced(for me, more than 3 times lesser) than the usual methods. If you use any other carrier /network like AT&T, I see their costs are always lil higher-about 5-10$ more for unlimited calls/mins.So, this way, these are the 2 main reasons, I would continue to use Rebtel for international calling, after my current 2 months usage.Also, I had an account registered on an earlier number which is not in service now. I was charged for the 2nd month cycle but, basically it was my mistake not to have deleted the account since, I forgot the pin. Later, one support representative has been kind enough to at least help me with deleting or not charging me for my old account. Only one thing, since, this company works out of Luxembourg, they delay a lil by a day or 2 while responding to ur customer service mails. But, they at least reply and are prompt in doing and trying to solve any issues.One more point is this service is available in UK, Dubai, Africa and other variety of places. They can may be expand their horizon.Good job. Happy customer...till now..!!! Congrats..and continue this way..Thanks",

Rebtel offered me a very convenient opportunity to communicate with family in Nigeria and elsewhere.  The practice of converting international numbers to local numbers made life really easy. Another point is the ability to recharge without breaking your discussion.  I have since recommended it for my wife.  In 2014 when my wife and I were in Texas we used Rebtel for the 5 months period of our stay.  Noe my wife is back to Massachusetts I made sure she continued with Rebtel.  i was pleasantly surprised that I can now use it in Congo and I have since registered and I am using it to call Nigeria.

The pre-set country dial code is irritating and requires too many clicks to change country destination calls whereas before I could just copy and paste a whole number including country code. Now with the preset country access if I paste it creates duplication of the first digits and requires more clicks to change to a different country. User interface was simpler to operate earlier I see no benefits in the new app. Customer service impossible to contact I had to go to discussion forum to find the email address and then took days to get a response that didn't answer my question, follow up was just ignored. New app not compatible with older versions of iOS. I'm a very early adopter of Rebtel but these changes makes me look at alternatives to be honest.",

    "text": "I was a loyal Rebtel customer for the past few years (about 4 years) and Rebtel has been a better choice for me. I even wrote an excellent review in the past concerning quality and great customer service compared to other services. The price has been an issue from the beginning until the recent outrageous hike made me update my review. Calling Ethiopia went from average 19 cents(US) up to 27 cents per minute. That is a difference of 8 cents per minute!! I was using a deal that allowed me to talk for 50 minutes with approximately $10. Now, $10 allows you to talk only for 34 minutes and that is 27 cents per minute. I have been sticking around after their price changes in the past ( partly due to the \"deals\") and the problem I had with my mobile carrier third party application issue but this time, I am leaving for good! A price hike like this is not acceptable and I will be posting this on social media so that other Ethiopians stop using this service. I know many people who are doing that already, thanks to free internet calls and more internet coverage to Ethiopia. Why should we pay this much in 2016? Bye Rebtel! I am cancelling my account as we speak. I will start by taking away my credit card information from my profile and try other services for this week. It is unfair.",

When dialing a number, you do not hear destination ringing, you hear some rebtel ring until  the other end picks up the phone. That means you do not know if the phone is closed, or rang. I am interested to have normal phone call where i hear whatever i hear when calling from normal phone.3. clunky application. No easy way to use access numbers.4. now no sms.5. a dialer is not supposed to be a nuclear reactor. Dialer is a dialer. Something that you can type a number and press dial. With options to copy paste modify the number. I dont need your assistance on finding the country code, i know what i want to call, so you should remove this stupid list of countries. One you have an app that works, and no one is complaining, just stick with it. I do not understand why you feel obliged and urged to invent the weel every now and then. It is a dialer - not a supersonic aircraft.Avoid this app.",

There is no customer service telephone number, and all of the responses about your issues will be slow. 4-5 days usually. I have had no other experience with Rebtel to make the think that it is different for anyone else. The most inconvenient part is that if you use Rebtel to make calls to Cuba like I do, that you can't talk with your friends or family until the issues are resolved because Rebtel unfortunatley is one of the few applications that will actually allow you to make calls to Cuba.That is the only reason I have tolerated their horrible and impersonal customer service.",

The new branding with it's poorly designed interface is a total and utter disaster! First time I logged in I couldn't dial any of my local numbers because they weren't ready yet! What? So they change their logo and interface and roll it out although it won't work! Joke. I can't edit numbers, I can't add any numbers, if I delete numbers it won't allow me connect a new one.I've been in contact with Rebtel via email for the past 3 or 4 days and the issues are still not sorted. I've had brief 'brush-off' replies from Maribel, Zahid, Alexandra and Vilhelm, just stalling and not understanding the issue. Very poor.

Whoever decided on the upside down logo must have seen tis coming because everything about Rebtel is upside down. Now I am searching for an alternative after being a loyal customer for years. Can't add a new number until I delete an old one and when I select one to delete, it gives me my 50 or so numbers to choose from without a name next to it...like I am supposed to remember everyone's number. I then went back into the local numbers directory to see whose number I could delete to free up space only to find out the numbers have been wrongly allocated. Now Paul's number is showing up under Steve's name and Steve's number is now someone else's. My goodness, you couldn't make up the upside down LOGO. Perfect for the new crap called Rebtel.I then try to delete one of my old phone numbers assigned to the Rebtel account. Shows me 3 numbers. I try to delete phone number 3 and see that 2 was deleted. I then selected to delete phone 2 and saw it ask for confirmation if I wanted to delete phone 3. Oh Lord!!!I have also read a lot of reviews and it is just so annoying when they reply asking you to send them a private message on facebook. C'mon!! Get a regular email. Why assume everyone must have a facebook profil? I have been off facebook for 5 years so I guess there is no way for me to contact Rebtel.

    "text": "In my opinion, Rebtel is an excellent example, how a great idea and innovation becomes a true disaster. I was probably one of the first international users of Rebtel and registered my numbers in 3 different countries. I found it fantastic and recommended it to many of my friends. As a result I received several credits and enjoyed sort of free calling for a while - until, suddenly, the credits got an expiration date! It's like taking an award away, but also taking my motivation away to recommend it to more friends. And while I don't really care, when Rebtel changes it's lovable logo to an aggressive red and upside down logo for no reason, I do care, when one of the most practical services - to use SMS - is taken away. This is not only absolutely ridiculous, but also unacceptable to change the rules for a service, that people might have signed up for, just to use the option of sending SMS, because it is (besides email) the best way to communicate with people in very different time zones.Some more bad news: When I tried to change some of my current \"local numbers\", they were DELETED, which also meant in some cases, that I lost these numbers completely. But when I tried to add those again, that I still had in my contacts with corrected info, the system tells me, that I ran out of local numbers and cannot add any additional ones.And don't you wonder, why there is not even a link on their webpages to contact any customer service? In the beginnings of Rebtel I was even in touch with one of their founders, Jonas Lindroth, now everybody is hiding in anonymity. I guess, their is a reason for that ...Maybe someone answers at least here to the following question: As I will not use Rebtel anymore, as soon as I cannot send SMS, how do I get my money back, that is currently on my 3 accounts (US, Europe, SouthEast-Asia)?P.S. I totally agree with all the other reviewers here, specifically with Raul Perez. The \"new\" Rebtel is a total disaster.",

    "text": "The new version of rebtel along with the customer people is awful now!!! What happened with you Rebtel!! I've been using your services for almost 6 years now and if you don't change I'm going to switch to another company. The main reason why I was with you guys was because you guys had the option to call somebody free by returning the call, now you are like any other company and even worst because your app is full of inconsistencies, bugs and it lacks of options, so it really doens't make any sense for me to keep using your services. Just in case you guys read this review the main things I can complain about is:1st and the most annoying, there's no place anywhere in the website or app where to contact customer service, my wife has a problem connecting and it just says \"something went wrong (what? who knows!) Please try again later or contact us (where?) if the problem persists\".2nd You guys are claiming that we can call for free to other people using the app without using wifi or internet but when I turn off wifi or mobile internet and I try to make a call to another person that has the app it says \"no internet connection to make this call\", so you are basically liars here.3rd. I sent a complain about the problems that I'm experiencing to the old support email that I have from you guys (I'm lucky I could find it in my old emails) and I just got an email saying that you guys received the complaint and I will be contacted as soon as possible, but 5 days have passed and I haven't had any luck by getting a response ticket number (#821300) in case you are interested. 4th. Your app is horrible now and your new look is horrible as well.and a list of the other complains so far: Where can I find the free call phone for each of my contacts?How can I know if the call I made or I received was a free call or a normal call?How can I see in the list of calls if it was an incoming call or outgoing one?I can't save my preferences after I click the button save, it says that my preferences were saved but I see the same options I had before. How can I change the number of a contact, it only let me change the name now?I'm thinking in going with other company as soon as I run out of credits seriously if you guys don't go back to the previous version you guys had before. It seems like Rebtel has a new owner or whatever but the new owner just doesn't know how to run the business. I mean you guys had millions of users and I bet each day you will lose more and more if you don't change that \"new version\".",

Few days ago I attempted to log in and make some international calls and was surprised on not just the look and feel of the new website but also the functionality. I don't know if you guys have a Quality Assurance department or what they do there but the old website was professional, easy to use and navigate, the new one is a joke.!!!! From the look I could tell this would be a disaster. I couldn't log in easily, the password was overlapping with the text in the password field, I couldn't view my contacts as they are still working on the contacts directory (joke), I could still make calls though as I had a balance, but certainly once I exhaust the funds, I don't have I'll still want to top up unless the mess is sorted out. You guys have an app on Apple store and Google play, fyi not everyone uses an I phone or an android device, I'm just hugely disappointed and hope who ever just took over the realms of office reads this. You set such high standards and now this??? I'm looking into shopping around from this point. Good Luck. Ade",

Rebtel did NOT offer any credit or free call time as a concession for the poor service and disconnected calls.  Other international phone companies always did SOMETHING to make it up to me in the past.Service was ok for about a year.  Still not the best prices.  Then,  calls would be disconnected in about 10 seconds when calling a land line in Ukraine.  Mobile phones were ok.  I tried contacting Rebtel...... their customer service link on their Website did not work.  I cancelled the Rebtel auto-refill immediately and found a better carrier.I left the above review and Rebtel's reply was to answer on Facebook.  I don't use Facebook.",

Onyeso Rebtel gave him Longinus local number. Does Rebtel have a limited number of local numbers that it can give after which it starts duplicating numbers?2) Rebtel's customer service number for my area 804 592 6932 does not have an option to speak to a human being. The main menu does not have the options for all the frequently asked questions. 3) The connections are good most of the time and the cost is fare.",

    "answer": "Hi Amita, I am sorry to hear you have had bad experiences with Rebtel. First, accounts should not created unless you sign-up for the service or you have been referred by your a friend. I would suggest contacting support again and asking them how and when was your account created.When it comes to accepting multiple credit cards, this is a security issue. This measure is taken to prevent people using cards that do not belong to them to make payments. We understand that this is an issue for you and apologize that it cannot be easier in your specific case. When it comes to your last issue, you can have one account for up to 5 different numbers.

I used 'phone cards until I realised their published rates only applied for the first 4 minutes of each call--then rates sky-rocket! It is very sneaky, this detail is in the small print. You may think you are paying, say, 9p/minute but you are likely to be paying 20-30p/minute.So I was delighted to find Rebtel, which did not engage in this underhand practice. With no card number to enter, Rebtel was easier to use and the ability to allocate a UK number to frequently called overseas numbers was brilliant. With Rebtel calling abroad whilst driving became easy.After a few months of being very happy with Rebtel (call quality is generally better than calling cards too), I noticed the cost of calls to Zambia had suddenly tripled! No notification, nothing. Needless to say, I no longer use Rebtel.Rebtel is a very good service but check the rates charged and keep checking--don't get caught out as I did.",

    "text": "Here is why I don't think Rebtel is using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation exclusively for terminating calls in Ethiopia. Two Scenarios1. Rebtel Call From USA to Ethiopia (terminated using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation)    * Call is good quality    * Phone in Ethiopia show caller Id of my USA number2. Rebtel Call From USA to Ethiopia (terminated NOT using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation)    * Call is bad quality(might even drop)    * Phone in Ethiopia show caller Id of local Ethiopian Mobile Number as if its a local callI believe this second scenario happens because call is terminated using internet so bypassing Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation and generating a local call using local Ethiopian Mobile Number to the destination number. Sometimes I even hear the exact unique 'your account is low' message (not the Rebtel message) used by  Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation as if I am calling from Ethiopian Mobile phone with low account.  The people I call in Ethiopia are confused to get a call from local Ethiopian Mobile number but talk to me (from USA).  My point is this second scenario does not happen if all Rebtel calls are terminated using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.The first thing I check when I place a call using Rebtel is ask the person I call if the number they get a call from is from my USA phone or local phone number. If it is my USA number, then great. If not and the caller Id is the local Ethiopian number, I am redialing again, because its bad quality and no use to continue with that call. I am clear that Rebtel uses different provider to route call. That is not the issue. The issue here is, which ever provider you choose should terminate calls using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.You have been giving me general answers and not addressing the issue (Scenario 2). Rebtel Calls are being terminated illegally in Ethiopia. But I am glad you recognize \"Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation\" is the only legal telecom provider in Ethiopia. Second Step is to weed out the providers that don't terminate calls using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.Thank you",

After 29 days they send me an email telling that the 500 minutes (of which i had not used a single one) was about to expire within 24 hours. In short the next day I went from 500 minutes to ZERO.

Many people bought the subscription in recent days and got terminated, how come there will be abnormal usage. And Rebtel is advertising like true unlimited, why so if not able to provide maximum usage.. Also many people had the credits in their account that also gone.. When we contact them , no proper answer for 2-3 days and finally giving default answer.. If you want to provide default answer then why are u waiting to reply after 2 days, u might have sent some auto reply with default message.. Full of disappointments..

I recommend Rebtel service to anyone whether you are new or transfer from another career to try their service at least once.  if not satisfy there is no contract or commitment that tie anyone to the company. a trial will convince you!    go rebtel, go rebtel, go rebtel!!!",

However, my phone broke and I got a new phone, same phone number. I forgot my login and i got new login and i lost all of my account money .. it is $0. I sent 2 emails from my phone and i just sent another email while searching using my computer and that makes me mad because I said good things about them and referred my friend to join them!  No reply? I hope I post this out they will response, if not... maybe you should be aware and think twice before you put money into Rebtel.Finally got a response from them. here is what they said....Quote:-The credit on your account expires 12 months from the last account activity (SMS or call) so as long as you SMS or call at least once a year, your balance will always carry over.This is clearly written in our Website in Legal/Terms of serviceUnquote*************************************Well.. I didn't read the terms in detail but I guess I will never ever use Rebtel again.  I don't think this is a good practice. Even I didn't use for a year, still I put the money into your company.  Lucky I found out there are many phone apps now that enable you to talk on the phone overseas like \"Line\" is good to use it as phone talking. I love WeChat for text messaging, Line's phone quality is better but you can try both. The video & talk not very smooth I guess depends on both connection.Goodbye Rebtel.

Before last week I always had a good experience about their quality of service, both technical service and customer service. I have recommended rebtel to my family members and friends in the past.Recently I had a bad experience.The support was poor for the first time. I recently changed my phone number. Therefore, I requested to transfer my money from old number to new number. There was  partial money from reference bonus. Ms.  Laura was customer agent from Rebtel end. She said that bonus credit is not transferable. It was absolutely fine if that is the Rebtel policy. I did not know Rebtel policy. So, I made my request and as a customer agent her job was to explain me nicely what can be done or cannot be done based on Rebtel Policy. However, in stead of nicely explaining me, she started to blame me that I am abusing and misusing. The terms \"abuse\" and \"misuse\" were very insulting and objectionable, especially when it was baseless and with an old customer.  It was very unprofessional behavior of Ms. Laura from Rebtel end. Then she threatened me to block my account in future.  Her whole message was rude, non-sense and unprofessional. I expressed my dissatisfaction about her rude language in response email. She never asked apology for this rude behavior.In the past I had opportunity to communicate with Ms. Cintia and Ms. Alexandra,who are very nice and professional but Ms. Laura was unlike them from Rebtel. It was a bad experience.   It gave me the feelings that Rebtel does not care their customers.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank You so much for the reply. I feel much better to see your reply. I am not sure about the facebook page. So, i am replying here. The case number was Request #709001. Just to clarify once again, I have no complain about not transferring the bonus credit. I did not know Rebtel's policy about bonus credit.  I HAVE complain because she behaved rude with me by using terms \"abuse\", \"misuse\" and by saying \"she would block my account in future.\"  That was an unacceptable treatment to a customer of more than 3 years old and who regularly use Rebtel by paying money every month.  The complain is about her behavior.Thank You once again.... :)",

I have been using this since last one month. On my mobile number i have free landline and mobile calls to any number in gerrmany. Rebtel gave a special number on which they charged me on every number that i called. I got a bill today of 136 euros for calling to india for which i used the plan from Rebtel. I have written them an email but no response. This is disgusting and ridiculous. I have never been charged from any international calling service that i have been using since years.

It says \" there is another call going on...\" . I understand this as enforced to make sure running call has enough mins to finish. but 200+ is too high threshold it should be reduced to 30 mins or so.Pros:Good thing is it works on wifi, so you don't have to worry about poor signal or phone minutes.-Comparatively cheaper for that quality- You don't feel the lag in hearing the conversation",

Created a local number for the example I mentioned an day 3. Wait a minute, I gave a example as support asked. Nothing is working. Not the example alone. Icing on the top was, the local number they gave, did not work again. Same message, credit more money. They also told me that as a policy they will respond within 48 hours.on Day (5), I Responded to rebtel that their \"Local access number\" itself is not working. That is what I meant in day (1) report.day 6 and 7) No response. Where is their 48 hours policy to respond to customers?It has been well past 48 hours since i responded to rebtel support.I think this company rolls out products without testing. If the stuff works for you, good. If it does not, your are by yourself and you are in for a wild ride. Their support is extremely unhelpful. They try to pass the ball without taking accountability. I have easily spent many hours worth of effort fighting with something that should just work. Their support is miserable. Please let me know if there are choices that I can do.

How can this happen?  And then when I tried to contact someone who can explain it to me , I found out that they don't have a customer support # !!!! Wow...Getting worse. . The only option is to email them & wait till they email you back at their own MERCY !!?

When I try to make call, the message I get is that I have no more credit. The last time this happened I bought additional credit but Still, I could not make a call.  This is very frustrating. The customer service is horrible, the worst of any company I have ever dealt with.  First of all there is no customer service telephone number where you can speak to an actual person. The only option is to leave a message.  When you get a response, it is to tell you that they will respond within 48 hours.  I should therefore wait until 48 hours to make a telephone call that could very well be an emergency?. I WILL GIVE THEM ZERO STARS.  They do not even deserve one star. How can a telephone company not have a telephone number for their customers to call.  I will never recommend Rebtel to any one. I will never use their service again until there is a customer service that actually works like a good company's.  THIS IS CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ITS WORST.Re: Response from RebtelI am not satisfied with your response. Why don't you have a customer service number that your customer can call for help?. A company that cares for its customer will be more sensitive to their concerns. You only confirmed what I said in my review that as a customer I cannot speak directly to a customer support staff who can help resolve a problem immediately. The only way to reach your customer support staff is through Email and the response can take up to 48 hours.  I still stand by my review.Re: Rebtel ReplyWhat is your customer service telephone number.  Why didn't someone call me directly to discuss thiis.",

I wonder if they deserve any customers at all...A reminder: when I signed up for Rebtel It was for a specific basket of services, for which I paid in advance.The basket \"shrunk\" - in other words Rebtel took the money and did NOT deliver on the services, and for a few years refuse to refund their ill-gotten-gains, and even the rep that contacted me did not have the honesty to answer a simple question!My advice: Use alternate app - and keep away from \"Rebtel\"!",

I have sent countless of emails to their customer service, they replied me just once and after that, i didn't hear from them again. Of course i got emails to rate their service, which i told them was very unsatisfactory. Would anyone be kind enough to refer me to a long distance provider. I usually call Nigeria and the UK.I have no problem posting the email associated with the account. Im not sending anymore private messages, cos it's been useless these past months. So i suggest the team involved in such matters find my account associated with this email and get back to me.

    "answer": "Hi Said, I can see you have two accounts and in both you initiated payments of 5usd but none was completed therefore the credit wasn't added.In one of the accounts indeed you have 7.80usd and there's no obvious reason as why you can't call. First of all please make sure you're trying to call from the number registered in the account that does have credit and not from the number registered in the empty account. If you're calling from the correct number, then it could be that you're trying to call using local minutes instead of internet and if you don't have enough credit with your local provider the call can't be placed; so please try placing a call via internet and if it goes through then that's the reason.If you have enough credit locally and can't call using internet either, please contact support@rebtel.com and we will gladly look into it and do our best to fix it. You can change the language in your account by going to your account click on your name/ settings and select language.The website can be language selected as well at the bottom of the page. /Wanda.",

But still I was charged !!! twice by ORANGE \u20ac includid IVA almost \u20ac 17 for 5 calls and by Repted the normal charge.

    "answer": "Hi Hans,When you call internationally through Rebtel by calling your access number or local number, you place a local call first then we will route your call internationally to your contact. This means that you pay your phone operator for the price of the local call and the international, Rebtel-carried part is charged through us, on your pre-paid Rebtel account. If you want to save the cost of the local call then you could place your calls via Wi-Fi or 3G through one of our apps for Android or iPhone.In order to help you further with your issue, please, be so kind to write to us to our e-mail support@rebtel.com providing us your registered telephone number with international format and a copy of your phone bill in PDF.Thanks in advance for your cooperation /Cintia",

Unfortunately a big part the cost or rate is  based on the cost that the local provider establish to connect the calls in its country, in the case of Cuba the local provider rates are high and that's why no matter from where in the world you're calling from, it's expensive to call to Cuba. Hopefully in the near future calling that destination would be cheaper, in the meantime we try to offer you  the best option available. /Wanda.",

I also use other phone service where I get real ring tone. with that I know how many time it was ring, If the phone is off, or out of network, or busy. Also if the receiver set a ring tone for me I can hear that too. But with Rebtel you are blind - until the other side pick up the phone and talk to you.Another thing is that, If you have a deal plan Rebtel does not tell you how many minutes do you have? or how many minutes left while you are calling.Most of my friends use Rebtel. People like me use Rebel to talk to their loved ones, who lived in overseas. Once they are here they stop the service because Rebtel becomes expensive on a monthly basis when you use with home phone or even with your cell phone for occasional use.",

So much about \"special low rates\".And they charge in $US or Euro. You CAN NOT select $AUD, which means every time you re charge you pay via 'bad' exchange rate (I checked this) and on top of that you might be charged 'international processing fee' (which is my case was approx $1 for every $10 purchased).

This is a real problem and questionable technique\u2026 dare I say \"scam.\" I'm already paying a local rate every time a call is initiated without connection using a local number during this erroneous ringing period \u2014 why should we also pay an international FOR NO CONNECTION? Curious how many of you have been experiencing this, but did not know.",

    "text": "I am an living in the US, using Rebtel for more than 2 years.I got an email from Rebtel yesterday, congratulating the Islamic Eid after Ramadan!I was really shocked to see that Rebtel has categorized me as a Muslim and is spying on my contacts! This is a very big marketing mistake for them! Rebtel is a telecom. company, and should not in any way involves the religious belief of customers in their marketing strategy. Rebtel SHOULD NOT spy on my contact lists! I am looking to replace Rebtel with something else due to these facts:- Bridge of my privacy and categorizing me as a 6-cylinder Muslim while I have no religious affiliation.- The quality is very very BAD for the first time connections. You have to re-call to get a better quality. In this way, they can charge more minutes! - I am not sure if they sell consumers data to NSA etc etc! What if I go under the surveillance of NSA etc etc because you Rebtel guys put me in practicing Muslim lists. If Rebtel does not provide any satisfactory explanation for me, I will definitely go after them both legally and on the net. I warn everyone about these serious issues.------This is my response to Rebtel team's response:------------------ Dear Rebtel Team,Religion is a very sensitive issue! PLEASE DO NOT use it for marketing purposes! You should be aware that in those countries, there are a large group of minorities who are suffering from religious related discrimination and violations!Let me give you an example to make the case clear if it is hard for you to understand my point: - Your job is to connect people in the best way! Not to congratulate the birth day of Muhammed, Moses or Jesus, based on the stereotypes! What about sending an email to Neo-Nazis congratulating Hitler's birthday, and having some Holocaust survivors in the that mailing list, too! Are you guys sending a Merry Christmas message to Christian minorities in these Islamic countries. Of course not!In short, you guys should not be identifying your diverse body of customers based on their religions!!! That is like labeling people! In all of those countries you named there are tens of non-Islamic religions. I might have called some of those countries that you named but this is my business and NOT YOUR business to track my calling list and put me in your \"Muslim Box\"! What if I call India another day: Am I a Hindu or Buddhist or Muslim or Christian or ...?!!! That is ridiculous! This is exactly what NSA programs are doing! Checking who is calling whom and how long and then label them! And they will be very pleased to know that you guys have reduced their work load with your religion boxes with the names of costumers!! Being at any points of the world, does not give you any immunity from NSA or other agencies! Are suggesting you guys have a better security than Google and Yahoo and Apple ;) By the way, are 100% of people in Sweden Christian and love Jesus and go to Church!? Of course not! So, that is non-sense to get religious messages involved in the business, specially cherry-picking for Muslims.",
    "answer": "Hi Alex,Thank you for your feedback. As you may be aware, people around the world use Rebtel to keep in touch with their friends and family. Our users are incredibly diverse and we try to celebrate all major festivals, be it Eid, Christmas, Diwali or Hanukkah. We would like to assure you that we do not categorize our users by religion. The Ramadan email was sent to Rebtel users that either live in or call countries such as Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt etc. If you don\u2019t live in or call one of these countries, then we would like to apologize to you. We take your privacy very seriously and never share your information, especially the NSA, as we are based in Sweden. Feel free to contact us at support@rebtel.com if you would like to know more.Best regards,The Rebtel Team",

First I bought some time and instead they gave me nothing. +0 to my account balance whoops it was a promo. So I asked for a refund which they did and instead removed money I already have in my account so I actually lost money by putting in money. Do not waste your time with this company. They charge you instantly regardless of whether they connect or not. A lot of these people giving the good reviews will go red once they see how the company really is.",

Besides, they are extremely opaque because they do not have a phone to call for your situation to be addressed.Zimbabweans and others out there, please if it sounds too good to be true, just stay away.

    "text": "STAY AWAY FROM REBTEL!! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. My story is below:_____________I (used to) buy between 2400 - 3000 minutes per month from Rebtel. So to say that I'm a loyal customer is an understatement. I typically buy the MaxSaver deals. This month Rebtel randomly locked my account. I contacted them right away and they did not respond for 3 days. The MaxSaver deals only last for 14 days. Hence I was unable to use my minutes for those 3 days (roughly 22% of the time given). I have ALWAYS exhausted the minutes in my MaxSaver deals. So this month I lost 285 minutes because they shut off my account. Rebtel refused to extend the deal but instead gave me 20 minutes as \"compensation\" for my inconvenience. I have an international startup and it was disrupted because of Rebtel. AND their solution: 20 minutes. I contacted customer service and their response was: _____________Thanks for contacting us!i totally understand your request but as stated before its not possible for me to extend the period of your deal since the deal no longer shows on your account.Every deal that expire, disappear totally from the users account.Best Regards,MartialCustomer Team____________Rebtel SHUT DOWN MY ACCOUNT for no reason so I wasn't able to use my minutes and then refused to either extend the deal for the 3 days they made the mistake, nor would they give me my minutes back. I have given that company thousands and this is the response that I receive?STAY AWAY FROM ANY COMPANY WHO RESPONDS LIKE THIS!!!!!!",

I contacted Customer services almost 10 times in over 2 weeks but they will not  respond. Avoid them at all costs or they could cost you huge amounts of money.Their mission statement states that they want to provide 'the first genuinely good, honest, and trustworthy global mobile telecommunications service that saves people money'. They have failed on every count. My original review was challenged by Rebtel within 2 days and has been suspended for review, yet their Customer Service department has still not contacted me. Unless you want to risk a similar experience I would strongly recommend avoiding this company.",

Sure, rebtel rates are fairly cheap but is it really worth it when both of us cannot make out what the other person is saying? We're constantly asking each other to repeat themselves because it's so muffled. We usually end our conversations more frustrated than anything because it's extremely annoying to have to repeat yourself over and over again. Also, there's a feature on the mobile app for collect SMS. Meaning the other person can text you and it will charge you. At least the SMS go through well, right? Well.. yes and no. I was ecstatic to find out that I can pay for her SMS sent to me because being in the Peace Corps, she's limited financially. I turned on the feature and let her know that she can text me freely because she does not have to pay for it. But did it charge me? Nope. Did it charge her? Yes.Rebtel has given me the worst emotional blue balls a phone service can possibly give to a person. Teasing me with the idea that I can talk to my significant other freely but turning around and slapping me in the face with horrible call quality and dysfunctional features.",

There are no frills, no gimmicks, just a fast-working method that brings me in contact with loved ones in New Zealand, the USA and elsewhere by dialing a special number. I am amazed at how cheap it is--I initially bought for ten dollars and still have almost five dollars left, after 10-12 calls each lasting more than ten minutes and some up to forty. I don't know how Rebtel does it, but I have just bought more time!",

My service was temporarily restored and after they were queried by my bank, they could not justify the charge the charge was reversed. Now they have Interrupted my account and shut it down. I am going to open a face book page and urge people to BOYCOTT REBTEL. I have been instrumental in getting many of my friends turned on to Rebtel. Now I am going to have to tell them about this experience.

However, the sound quality is not always as good as it should be, and calls are often just dropped for no apparent reason, followed by redialing that does not reconnect the call. T reconnect, I must hang up and redial again. All the Rebtel calls I have made have been to a cellphone in the Dominican Republic.  Sound quality is also occasionally terrible when using calling cards to the same country from the US.",

    "text": "I've lived in South & North America for some time; have had a chance to use Rebtel for 6 month or so. First, let me talk about their SMS service. It sucks! I'm not sure how the system selects on what phone number to assign an SMS icon, most of the time the icon does not appear next to the contact that was added, and an e-mail to the customer service has to be sent, and their reply which will take days to say \"we have received your e-mail\" and then another days to say, it has been fixed. Which I don't have time to wait for, all these in days?? Even when you sent an SMS, it gets delayed almost 90% of the time, and Rebtel always blames the 3rd world countries or the developing countries Telecommunication service, which I have hard time to believe when I can send an sms to 3 different people leaving in the same city/region and radius, only 1 will get the sms in minutes, while the others gets it in hours or even days later. Are you kidding me Rebtel???The phone service is acceptable considering, occasionally a network problem which can happen with all VIP phones; however whenever I added minutes almost all the time, I won't see my added minutes or balance for another 10-20 minutes, and that is a time I can't afford to lose, since most calls are made overseas and there are time zone concerns and etc...so timing is very important to me, which I never got from Rebtel till the end. I have had a handful of dropped calls while calling different parts of the world; I was given a credit for some, which is of course after complaining. Due to all my experiences,  I did not feel comfortable leaving my CC information saved there during that 6 month I was using.Now as I write this, my account has been blocked for unknown reason, it's still locked and I'm tired of going back and forth with their inconsistent customer service I was forced to abandon my account and look for other service elsewhere.",

All together I have sent approximately 13 emails, in which I get such responses about how their \"Engineers\" are working round the clock. My $25.00 is yet to be posted to my account.

I can also use my mobile with 800 minutes for landllines and mobile lines in the Netherlands for that. I don't have to be online after I have purchased credit for my Rebtel account. The fees for several countries are great. India is cheaper than ever. I used to have \u20ac0,015 as the smallest fee and several times I paid \u20ac0,02 to \u20ac0,03/minute. Now only \u20ac0,008 and only when the line is answered. Ghana and Mali have competetive prices. They can't still be cheap as \u20ac0,07 would be. But they are just below \u20ac0,15 and that's quite a standard price for other cheap ways of calling those countries. Rebtel has managed to keep their prices a little below that price of \u20ac0,15 which I consider a great accomplishment.Uganda and Kenya and even Pakistan are relatively cheap at \u20ac0,07 app. Very happy about that.Sending an sms must be done on the website. However you can type fast as you can use a normal keyboard which isn't possible on a handy. Sms's are cheap. I would have to pay \u20ac0,55 for sending an sms to India with my mobile phone provider. Now with Rebtel it costs \u20ac0,02. I also get to see when the sms is delivered. Great! I can see exactly how long it took for the sms to be delivered. I can also allow the other person to call me back or sms me back at my cost. Best of all: I don't have to pay incase the other person doesn't answer the phone. Incase I would use a cheap service number (0900 numbers) in the Netherlands for which I can call India for \u20ac0,02 I would still have to pay for the 1 minute and 25 seconds I was trying to reach him. That is rounded to 2 minutes so it would cost me \u20ac0,04 in total. If I would do that multiples times (as I have done at times) I am still spending a lot of money.On the downside: I can't let somebody call me back or sms me back for free incase they don't have a working internet connection on their mobile phone. They might not have a subscription for internet or their bundle might have finished or they might not have purchased internet as they might not have enough money for that. In all of these cases they can't just simply call me back at my cost. That's different with a Collect Call. An operator will ask permission and will connect the other person to me at my cost. It is expensive of course but it works. Now however people can only respond incase they can access the internet. It would have been nice if the system recognizes that I have used Rebtel for sending the sms or for calling them so that the system automatically will deduct the collect call fees for a call or sms of my Rebtel account.Keep going!",

However, in a recent experience, I called someone, they didn't answer, but then they called back using the Rebtel numbers, and unknowingly I somehow \"accepted\" a collect call. Because I believed the rate to be 1.5 cents per minute, I talked for 30 minutes, only to find my account charged for close to $9. Apparently a small noise made at the beginning of my call was supposed to alert me that I was getting charged at this absurdly high rate. I think it's abusive of Rebtel to believe anyone could figure that out. I promptly went into my settings and changed my alert for receiving collect calls - I suggest all other users do the same. But I am now much more hesitant to use Rebtel due to fear of other hidden charges.",
    "answer": "Hi Jessica,You can change in your settings if you want to accept collect calls or to be asked in advance if you accept the charges, is good that you found already those settings and changed them. Since a collect call is an incoming call, we will charge the rate of your own country and not the rate for the country where you are receiving the call from. We regret any confusion about this, you can read about how our collect calls work in our FAQ: http://www.rebtel.com/en/Get-Help/faq/Making-Calls/What-is-a-Collect-Call/#What-is-a-Collect-CallWe do not have any hidden costs.Sorry for any confusion caused!",

It provides different ways to make calls, over the internet/ 3G/ wifi using application on your phone or PC (windows only), calling local access number and assigning a local number to your frequently called number (useful when there is no internet or you don't have a smartphone, my preferred way). So you can make international calls even if you don't have smartphone or internet connectivity. On top of that, Rebtel provides cheapest rates. Thanks for the service.",

That beats any other provider, also no 0844 or 0870 numbers to call, where the connection charges are 14.0p, plus poor quality service.With this you pay a fixed rate and can call from your mobile or landline, where ever you are. Also you can assign local numbers such as 020, 0121, 0114 etc numbers, so when you call that number the call gets directed to the international number, saving you lots of money.I'm very happy with the service and will continue to use this unless someone else comes along and offers rates around 0.01p, which I very much doubt for now.",

Perhaps the low credit message you heard came from your phone operator?

On my recent call to Japan, I was able to hear my mother on the other end, but she did not hear me at all, so she hung up - 7 cents for this. Both of us could hear each other on the 2nd call. Then my phone lost battery, so the call was terminated, and I called again. Same as the 1st call - my mother did not hear me - another 7 cents for nothing. I called back and it worked okay for a while, but my balance was getting low, so I added funds ($10) during the call. Guess what? The call was ended by Rebtel when the balance dropped to $10.03. Yes, there were beeps and notifications, and also automated operator was asking me to add funds. I already added funds online, so I did not add more funds on the phone. I switched from Google Voice due to the fact I had to close my Google accout. Rebtel calls worked better at the same rate of 2 cents a minute as Google Voice, before the rate went up to 7 cents.

Although I have had so far courteous service from Customer Services, this problem was logged 3 days ago and nothing has been done since.  This is deeply frustrating as I need access to a VOIP/sms serviceI have uninstalled the Rebtel App from my android phone as I consider that neither Rebtel nor google nor anyone else needs to have access to my private contact list nor any other private data. I think the ubiquitous collecting of data by suc services as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and now Rebtel  should be of great cocern to everyone but most do not think about the consequences.  I do nd am not prepared to give up control of my personal data to anyone un-necessarily.  I have paid to use this service and as far as I am concerned Rebtel should only require the information needed to administer the account and payment,  I wish to continues to use this service but I will only consider using Rebtel's web page based services.  If it refuses to unlock my account then I will have to ask for a refund and fnd another provider that will provide a service to me that is not so intrusive and controlling.",

We do understand it might be inconvenient for good customers like you, we are therefore working on a better way to keep our loyal users from getting locked. I have unlocked now your Rebtel account and made some changes that hopefully will prevent your account from getting locked next time you use your VPN. Regarding your address book: Rebtel needs access to your contact list in your address book to find out which of your contacts you can call for free. We only use this information to connect free calls between you and your friends and to be able to notify you when friends in your address book sign up for Rebtel and you can call them for free. This information will never be shared with any third-parties, sold, or misused in any way.I hope you find this information useful!Warm Regards,Rebtel Customer Team",

This makes us as frustrated as you. We hate that it hurts you as our customer and we hate that it scams us. A provider down the line of connecting your call is sending us a signal saying that the call is connected even when it is not, as in your cases. Rest assured that we are putting a lot of effort in detecting this so that we can report the issues to our providers and avoid charging you. In the meantime we kindly invite you to mail us at support@rebtel.com and give us the number registered to your Rebtel account, we will be glad to refund the calls that failed to connect and were charged to your account.",

We could drop our rates to a minimum, but a consequence of that would be that you and the rest of our users would pay for a sub-standard service with poor quality. That wouldn't make anyone happy. One solution is to earn free credit. You can do so by going to https://www.rebtel.com/en/app/account/signin?returnUrl=%2fen%2fapp%2ftaf%2f and inviting your friends to try Rebtel. If they like it and end up making a deposit, you get $10 of credit. Very best, The Rebtel Customer Team",

The number you wish to call has to be copied in writing from your contacts menu, then quickly upload the dialing pad to dial the number. Can there be a solution ?",

Not to mention Rebtel prizes are really cheap for some direction what I use on regular basis. I could imagine cheaper prizes for some direction (e.g.: Hungary), adding friend to contact list on PC seems not always works perfectly, missing video call option in case you want to use PC-PC call, no possibility to follow up my balance during the call (calling from PC application), what could be really annoying in case I would be close to my limit.Rebtel website also should make some reorganisation on main page, before joining it was really hard to find calling rates, but that should be on focus every time to find it easy. It is really positive they show how many minutes you could get by $10, but would be great to see even my available balance how much minutes worth to different directions.All in one: I recommend them, I'm happy to be their customer but would be happy to see some  more improvement from Rebtel.",

It doesn't make it impossible to communicate but there is a room to improve for sure... Also the\"1- 800\" alike free calls should be available to make Rebtel an all around service...  Managing and analyzing everything from my credits to calls I made is pretty good and easy. Being able to receive collect calls is pretty flexible. And the assigned 7 digits local numbers corresponding to my international numbers makes the process very pleasant and swift. To be able to use these facilities with multiple phone numbers is very nice as well...And I certainly appreciate the quality of responds that arrives eventually :)Although one would say that a potentially renowned telephone company should have  A Customer phone number available to desperately help seeking customers... Even though as terrifying as it sounds! I'm looking forward to get some complementary bonus rounds introducing your company...  Keep up the good work..PS. I realize that my review sounds a bit promotional and I must apologize for that.. Hence your advice to be as friendly as possible but  this is what I could offer so that's what just I did... :)",

I needed sth cheap to stay in touch with my friends and family in Poland. However I found out the hard way that rebtel  fees and rates are not as clear as company want us to believe in. For example when you top up credit they charge extra tax to it. So for example a 20\u20ac credit actually costs you 23\u20ac. But it's not all. According to the rebtel website a single minute to polish mobile phone should cost me 0,119\u20ac but after a brief chat with my sister ( around 4 min) 1,5\u20ac disappeared from my account. Connection itself isn't great either. So overall not sure if  Rebtel is such a great deal after all.  At least not for me!",
    "answer": "Hi there Agata, thanks for your comment. Very sorry to hear about your experience. With regards to the tax, this is not money that we get to keep. As an EU-based company, we're required by law to charge VAT on all payments made by EU residents. I see that you're based in the US, so you must have entered your Polish credit card details, as US residents aren't charged VAT. Also, minute rates to some Polish mobile phone providers differ in rates. We recommend to always have a thorough look through rates page of the country you intend to call. You can find the Polish rates page here http://www.rebtel.com/en/Cheap-Calls/Poland/",

The first call using wifi/3g would always be bad (sound cut up) but the next call is always a better one. I dont know why but that has been my experience. And the other thing about the android app. Whenever I tried selecting a contact using the dial pad from the rebtel app, the number of the contact that I choosed never shows up, it always comesback with a UK phone number it can be very annoying. Please fix that.And lastly please make rebtel available in bangladesh, so that we both can talk at a local rate. Thanks.",

The majority of my calls are to Thailand and you raised the cost/minute by almost 300% !!!  Why was that necesssary RebTel?  Are you getting a bit greedy?  I suspect that your ISP has not raised your costs at anything like that percentage, if at all....2) Why should customers have to Pay VAT on call credit?

When this happens, you must email them and wait for a reply.  There is no customer service number, email is the only method of communication.  In both cases, I was locked out due to a specific number they claimed I called.  I was told that number was in a block of numbers that they claim have been perpetrators of fraud on their service.  I have never called the number they claimed I called.  Hopefully their automatic fraud detection system will improve, as it is obviously quite buggy.  I'm sure they could have handled this better as well.  Other than that, the price is right and I haven't noticed any issues with the call quality.

Some phone services have hi-fi methods/plans which may be tough to implement by the common man.But Rebtel is simple, cheap and seems to be way better than conventional calling methods. Here the phone bell rings immediately as you dial the number, unlike other phone services which I have tried in this past. Though they charge a minimal price, yet the Call quality has been excellent so far.After I got accustomed to this service and was satisfied about the same, I encouraged my loved ones to register with Rebtel. My family in abroad has been using this since a year and even my relatives and friends who are dispersed across the globe. All of them are thankful to me for recommending Rebtel.The company offers you very reasonable international calls rates to various locations by assigning specific local phone numbers to your calls recipients in their countries. Rebtel also offers you the benefit of several freebies. You can call your friend and ask him to hang up for some time, and call you back while you stay on the line. You'll be connected and you get the \u2018free\u2019 call advantage of the international part. It may sound weird but trust me it works.Also, you get a trial 5-minutes phone call to any number and not to forget all calls between Rebtel members are free. However, to enjoy this freebie, your friend may not necessary be a Rebtel subscriber at all but both of you must be living in one of the 51 Rebtel countries.",

Both the kids are very responsible and manage their activities on their own. We have tried several cheap international calling facilities, but none of them had good voice clarity, and surprisingly none of them turned out to be cheap as promised.Our neighbours recommended Rebtel. They had a lot to say about Rebtel and its cheap international calling plans. They were quite convincing and we too tried Rebtel. As a starter we got 5 minutes of free calling and since it was Easter week the call rates were further low than their normal rates. Our kids love this service and believe me the voice clarity is very good. Not to forget, Rebtel to Rebtel calling is free, so most of the times we are actually speaking free, unless we have to call some other number. Recently I got an e-newsletter from Rebtel, they serve more than 51 countries and every week they have some special offer.Its good to know how technology can help you save money.

My contact list is programmed into my phone andeach one has a unique phone number, and it\u2019s great to ask the other person to call. This serviceisn\u2019t expensive and the rates are way better than calling cards. The quality of each call brings asmile to me.Initially Rebtel sounded a little strange to request the other party to call back but later on itbecame a routine. It\u2019s so cool! I make a call to someone and he says shall I call you back? Iwould suggest, if it\u2019s going to be short calls then don\u2019t ask for a call back, since the rates are wayaffordable.Let me not forget to mention about quality, since I am frequent international caller I tried severalcalling card which used to charge me a heavy price. Not only that, even the quality of the eachcall was way bad and the wait time for the ring was too long. The service would cause painrather than comfort. I used to get cut off so often that would disturb my business conversation.With Rebtel the call quality is crystal clear and it starts ringing right away.So if you want to save your money and make life easy, Go for Rebtel!Good: Ease to execute and great call qualityBad: None",

My son explained to me the concept of Rebtel which is based on internet telephony and why the calls made using Rebtel are cheap. Both of us have local Rebtel numbers on which we make a call, which gets internationally connected and that's how we speak to each other, every third day. And it is super easy to use. I don't have to worry about the bill s I can make payment through my credit card.I would sincerely recommend their customer support for guiding me through the entire process. Since my son is always busy on field, I take help from Rebtel customer support. The support system is apt and easily understandable by someone like me who is not technology friendly.

If your credit card is stored on your account you will have the option to top up (by for example pressing the '*' key (for the main menu) and then the '3' key to add credit over the phone).We have refunded your remaining balance. The funds should be returned in 3-5 business days.We hope this clears things up!Best regards,/Pilar.",
